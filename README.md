# country-region-city-api

An API developed by [MedUnes](https://medunes.net). 
World country + world regions + world cities in dependent dropdown menus.
Very suitable for sign up forms, shipping forms, etc. 

API Key can be obtained from [here](https://battuta.medunes.net).

Original Demo provided by [MedUnes](https://codepen.io/medunes/pen/GWoojz), but it depends on multiple factors and doesn't work properly on mobile devices.

[Here is my updated demo that only uses Bootstrap and jQuery](https://codepen.io/sam-shudukhi/pen/EQNMvy?editors=1010)

# Temporary API Key: 

var key = '00000000000000000000000000000000';
